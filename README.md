## Hanabi Game:

Currently, the Hanabi game can only be played in the terminal with minimum :two: players (*a computer bot has not yet been developed* :sweat_smile:) 

To test it out, you need to have `java` and `sbt` installed, then 
1. Open the Terminal, 
2. clone or fork this project
3. cd to the project directory
4. type in `sbt`
5. Once `sbt` has been started, type in `run` with a lot of *lucks*, you should be able to start playing :grin:
